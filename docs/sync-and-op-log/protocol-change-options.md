# Sync protocol change: options after the stopping point

**Status:** decisions D1–D10 recorded 2026-10-02 (tracker
[#10393](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/10393),
queue item 5); see [Decisions](#decisions). The option (6) spike reported on
2026-10-03 and (6) was rejected (D11, [spike result](#spike-result-2026-10-03)).

**Why now.** The stopping point (decided 2026-10-01) says a protocol change is
indicated when a fix needs (A) a new wire key, (B) accepted newly failing
compare entries on original seeds, or (C) a second exception to a generic
rule. Measured on master `1620939` (2026-10-02), after #10448, #10443 and
#10452:

| Criterion            | Fired?             | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| (A) new wire key     | Yes, by the letter | #10452 added the optional `deleteNote.note` key. It was the mechanism @johannesjo chose, so its session judged (A) not to fire; the criterion asks whether a fix needed one, and it did.                                                                                                                                                        |
| (B) accepted entries | **Yes**            | #10448: 7 seeds; #10443: 11 entries on 7 seeds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| (C) second exception | Arguably           | `contributor-sync-model.md` records one rule 13 exception, the NOTE recreate (#10452) re-listing in `project.noteIds`/`todayOrder`; the TASK recreate's `project.taskIds` re-list predates the rule and is its precedent. #10443 adds an admission (a pending note or habit order stays out of a conflict) beside #10364's. (B) alone suffices. |

So incremental fixes have reached the point where each one costs an accepted
trade or an exception. This note lists what is left, the options, and the
decisions needed.

`older-write-won` by class, each seed read on its original 30-step trace
(no new class; none is #10437 or #10422):

| Class  | Seeds                                                                                                                                            |

| #10438 | `noReorder:20725003` (title; #10438's source seed), `tasks:20725017` (title, notes), `tasks:20725025` (notes)                                    |
| #10421 | `noReorder:20725019` (notes; close to #10438's per-op split), `tasks:20725009` (notes; a delta beside absolute writes still sent a full replace) |

In the three #10438 seeds the resolving device's `'replace'` row carries an
older value with a merged clock that dominates the newer write, so every other
device ends on the older value while the resolver keeps the newer one.

Pins: 56 of 57 pass; the one failure is the stale #10443 pin that #10452
improved; #10453 has since re-pinned it on master.

**Order-only, new since #10452.** A device that reorders a project's notes and
pins the note keeps a re-listed note at its own position, while every other
device appends it. Permanent, order only; before #10452 the note was missing
from both lists. Accepted as order-only on 2026-10-02 ([#10393](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/10393#issuecomment-5944061436)).
It heals on the next reorder of that list; only an order merge removes it,
not membership derivation.

## How resolution reaches the fleet

On SuperSync, the server detects conflicts from vector clocks, entity ids and
action type; it never resolves on payload contents, and with E2EE it cannot.
It compares an upload only with the latest stored op of each declared entity
(`resolveConflictForExistingOp`, `conflict.ts`) and accepts it only if its
clock dominates that op (or equals it from the same client, a retry). It
also accepts a concurrent op without a check in three cases: both ops are
time deltas, the op is a full-state op, or the two ops declare no common
entity. The last case covers undeclared cross-entity list
writes (`docs/plans/2026-09-26-sync-architecture-review.md`). Resolution rows
(`'patch'` or `'replace'`) go through the same check; they pass because the
resolver merges both sides' clocks.

**Correction (option (6) spike, 2026-10-03).** An earlier version of this
section said "one device resolves, everyone applies its rows", and concluded
that a single resolver gives convergence. That claim is wrong:

- **Every device holding a losing op resolves.** Each one resolves its own
  crossing: on download against its pending op, after a rejected upload, or in
  a no-pending crossing (#9073). With three devices editing one task offline,
  the second and third uploader each resolve the same entity. A third device
  that downloaded only the first op before the second device's row landed
  resolves a different pair. Its row is then rejected as concurrent, and it
  resolves again (`RejectedOpsHandlerService`,
  `SupersededOperationResolverService`).
- **The server still keeps one chain per declared entity.** Every row it
  accepts dominates the one before, and every device applies that chain in
  server order. So the replicas end up equal on declared entities, but their
  content is whatever the resolver of each accepted row produced. An old
  resolver's row is accepted and propagates.
- **Where ops stay concurrent, the server does not serialize them.** It lets
  through concurrent time deltas, full-state ops and undeclared cross-entity
  writes. Full-state ops replace state (`SyncImportFilterService`).
  Undeclared writes are never detected as a crossing. A receiver without a
  pending op checks a concurrent op against its retained history (#9073,
  `_buildNoPendingConcurrentConflict`): commuting pairs, such as concurrent
  time deltas, apply as they are, and the rest are resolved on that device.
  So two resolver versions can apply different results there. This needs a
  test with several resolving clients, not an argument from a single
  resolver.

Two consequences:

- **Resolve-time changes** (what the resolving device emits) converge on
  declared entities in a mixed fleet on SuperSync: the server serializes rows
  per entity. They do not preserve content in a mixed fleet: an old client
  that resolves still loses data the old way, and its row is the one everyone
  applies. Where a concurrent op reaches receivers unserialized (above), each
  receiver resolves it locally, so convergence needs every resolver to reach
  the same result. On file
  providers there is no referee, so every device that downloads a crossing
  resolves it. An old and a new resolver can then emit different rows, which
  the convergence contract (`conflict-journal-and-review.md`) forbids. This is
  unverified, since the harness cannot run released clients
  (`lww-field-level-resolution.md`).
- **Apply-time changes** (how a device applies an incoming op, e.g. "skip a
  field whose stored timestamp is newer") diverge in a mixed fleet: old
  clients apply the whole op, new clients skip. They need every device on the
  new rule, i.e. the floor (#10397), and the floor cannot reach file providers
  (`client-version-floor.md` item 8).

Released clients drop unknown envelope keys and apply `'patch'` as
`updateOne`, `'replace'` as `setOne` (`lww-field-level-resolution.md`;
re-read on `v19.1.0`). They spread every key of `actionPayload` into the
entity, so new metadata must ride the envelope, never `actionPayload`, or old
clients persist it as entity fields.

| **Idea**           | When resolving, learn which fields an op writes by applying its reducer to a copy of the root state and diffing the entity, instead of a hand-written per-action extractor; keep a local, never-synced per-field index of the latest write; resolve per field and emit today's `'patch'` rows. Time deltas extend the existing rebase (`keptLocalTimeDeltas`/`keptTimeDeltasToRebase`, `conflict-field-patch.util.ts`) instead of losing to LWW. Since #10422 the rebase covers both directions for readable sides; decision 7 as replaced on 2026-10-01 keeps a pending delta through a remote win only when the winner writes no time; D10 settles winners that write time and #10378 |
| **Fixes**          | The field-level residue of opaque TASK, PROJECT, TAG and habit producers (#10421, #10438's shape). Not NOTE while decision 4 holds (`note.content` 10 and `note.isLock` 6 seeds stay). The rebase extension targets #10378 and #10380's task half, which (2) does not fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Mixed fleet**    | Converges on declared entities on SuperSync, where the server keeps one chain of accepted rows per entity, though every device holding a losing op resolves (see the correction above); a concurrent op the server lets through is resolved again by every receiver that finds a non-commuting crossing (#9073). On file providers it is worse than (1): the index is per device, so two resolvers of the same crossing can emit different rows. Old resolvers keep emitting `'replace'` rows with absolute `timeSpentOnDay`; a rebased delta after one can count time twice, so the rebase must not sit beside a `'replace'` row                                                       |

Meta-reducers such as `planTasksForToday` need the root state. A diff misses writes of an equal value, so the field set depends on the base state. On SuperSync the server lets a crossing pass only when both ops are `syncTimeSpent` (`conflict.ts`), so a delta against `planTasksForToday` is still rejected and must be rebased by the client                       |

#### Spike result (2026-10-03)

The spike ([#10482](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/pull/10482),
closed unmerged) built (6) behind the resolver's existing opacity check. It
used an in-memory index of capture-time state diffs, and derived incoming
opaque ops by running the root reducer on a state copy. It needed no wire key
and no bump. Measured on the 120 standard seeds against `d9cc190`:

- **Gains:** 16 compare entries stop failing. Seeds with any signature drop
  from 103 to 98, `field-reverted` from 40 to 28, time loss from 23 to 21
  and `older-write-won` from 4 to 3. Almost all of it comes from two
  producers, `planTasksForToday` and the habit `setCounterToday`, whose
  payloads already carry what they write.
- **Regressions:** 3 entries newly fail, all list divergence on seed
  20725005 (project `taskIds` and `subTasks`). Each mechanism also exists
  on master.
- **Two more exceptions were needed.** Reading `planTasksForToday` first
  broke two of #10462's tests
  (`time-delta-kept-beside-timeless-winner.integration.spec.ts`):
  - **The field-patch path re-sent a delta.** The crossing of a local
    auto-plan and delta with a remote edit became eligible for a field
    patch. `keptLocalTimeDeltas` keeps every delta, without #10462's rule
    for a delta a remote clock covers, so a delivered delta was re-sent
    (`DUPLICATE_OPERATION`).
  - **The rejected delta was lost.** The same crossing read as disjoint, so
    no conflict was built. The delta the server had rejected never reached
    #10462's survival rule, and A and C ended with 0.
  - **The fix:** derived ops are kept out of both paths when a time delta is
    present. The numbers above are measured with that guard.
- **Exit criteria:**
  - **Equal-value writes:** not detected. The synced habit op always writes a
    value its local, unsynced increase already applied, so its capture diff is
    empty, while the receiver's diff depends on its own count.
  - **Cross-entity writes:** seen, but unusable. They are undeclared, they are
    order lists, and they depend on the device's day.
  - **Restarts:** lose the index.
  - **File providers:** the same op is opaque on its author and readable on
    its receivers, which breaks the identical-field-set contract.
  - **Branch deletions:** none. Every opacity branch stays as the fallback,
    and the delta paths needed two new exceptions, so (6) fails as a
    simplification.

### Membership versus order (option M, formerly (5); design later)

`project.taskIds`, `project.noteIds` and `note.todayOrder` hold membership and
order at once. A child fact exists (`task.projectId`, `note.projectId`,
`note.isPinnedToToday`). Deriving membership from it and keeping the list as
order only, as `TODAY_TAG` does (ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md Decision #2), only
helps together with an order merge:

- **Derivation alone does not converge order.** TODAY already derives
  membership from `dueDay` (`computeOrderedTaskIdsForToday`,
  `work-context.selectors.ts`), yet its stored order is the largest divergence
  signature: all 40 `tag.taskIds` seeds are TODAY (the harness has no other
  tag). Convergence comes only from a deterministic order merge (kept order,
  unknown ids appended by a stable key), which also removes #10452's
  order-only difference.
- **Derivation is not display-only.** Tasks have no backlog flag, so a derived
  member needs a `taskIds` vs `backlogTaskIds` rule. `moveItemAfterAnchor`
  (`work-context-meta.helper.ts`) does nothing when the moved item is in the
  stored list but the anchor exists only in the derived one. More than 100
  code lines across about 34 files read or write the stored lists, and the
  plugin API exposes `taskIds`, `backlogTaskIds` and `noteIds`.
- **The rule 13 recreate exceptions stay** while released clients read the
  lists ("Existing lists stay", `contributor-sync-model.md`).
- Data repair already treats `projectId` as the authority
  (`_addOrphanedTasksToProjectLists`, `data-repair.ts`).

## Recommendation

This is the combined recommendation of two review subagents, as given to
@johannesjo in the design-note session on 2026-10-02. It replaces the
defaults first posted on #10393 (comment 5944338767).

1. Apply rule 15 as written; no blanket stop. Next fixes, each with an E2E
   first in both directions: **#10378** (tracked time lost on default
   settings; time loss is the second-largest family, 44 seeds) and **#10438**
   (permanent divergence).
2. Do not commit to (2). Spike (6) first: it fixes the field-level residue
   without a wire key or a floor, which (2) cannot offer file providers. If
   (2) is chosen later, use hybrid logical clocks, not wall clocks.
3. Keep decision 6 until the spike reports; drop only the per-action form of
   (1).
4. Reject (3).
5. Design membership derivation together with the order merge (option M);
   no separate derivation PR.
6. Plan the file-provider format alongside any apply-time change. A partial
   lever exists: clients from v18.14.0 with split sync off pause on the
   split-file tombstone (`file-based-sync-format.ts`). Not covered: clients
   older than v18.14.0, and split-on readers meeting a newer split version.
   Released ones (v19.1.0) treat it as recoverable corruption and restore
   from `.bak`, so by code reading their next upload can overwrite the newer
   file; only master since #10255 (unreleased) refuses it (`isRemoteNewer`).
7. #10438's fix shape: one decision per entity per batch, or #10421's
   post-batch field patch. Not "a time-only side needs no snapshot": on the
   resolving device the local side is a rename.

## Decisions

@johannesjo answered the recommendation above on 2026-10-02 in the
design-note session: "Do as recommend". D6 was decided earlier the same day
("Please spin up two sub agents on the decisions and do as they recommend",
[#10393](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/10393#issuecomment-5944061436)).

Two follow-up questions, answered the same day in the design-note session
("Do it as recommended", in reply to the recommendation below each):

| #   | Question                                                                          | Decided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| D9  | May the (6) index record fields written by incoming resolution rows?              | No, for now. The index records only this device's writes and plain incoming ops. A resolution row is the resolver's snapshot and can carry another device's older value at the resolver's time (#10438's mechanism), so decisions 5 and 5a stay unchanged. If the spike shows the index is too sparse without them, it comes back with evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| D10 | Does a pending time delta survive a remote win whose winner writes time (#10378)? | Yes in principle, by causality. Against a plain winning op: if the winner's vector clock covers the delta's op, the absolute total already counts it, so drop it; if they are concurrent, re-apply the delta on top. Against a resolution row, whose merged clock can cover an op whose value it lacks (#10438), the #10378 session first shows from real traces which case occurs; where the clock cannot be trusted, keep the delta (a visible double count the user can correct beats silently lost time). E2Es in both directions plus a no-double-count test |

D10 extends decision 7 as replaced on 2026-10-01, which kept a delta only
when the winner writes no time.

After the spike reported (2026-10-03), @johannesjo answered "Do as

(Recommended)". The row below records that recommendation:

| D11 | Adopt option (6) after the spike? | No. Decision 6 stays. The losses the spike fixed (task edits crossing an auto-plan, habit counts) stay recorded residue under rule 15: a fix needs a user report. Reading `planTasksForToday`'s and `setCounterToday`'s own payloads would need D3 reopened and its own original-seed compare |

## Missing evidence

- Version spread per app version on SuperSync (#10397), to size the mixed-fleet
  window for any apply-time change. v19.0–v19.1 send `appVersion` on
  downloads only.
- Whether v19.1.0 shows #10438 (diverges or only reverts the field).
- A per-seed split of `field-reverted`/`field-unwritten` by producer.
- Two file-provider resolvers of one opaque-op crossing: no harness drives
  them (the (6) spike argued this from code only).
