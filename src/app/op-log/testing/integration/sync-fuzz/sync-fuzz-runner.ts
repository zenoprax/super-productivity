/**
 * Per-field last-writer-wins across devices: a field that several intents
 * wrote converges on the value of the one with the latest own edit time
 * (timestamp, then clientId, as sync-core's planner breaks ties).
 *
 * The latest write may lose only a conflict that LWW lets it lose. For every
 * intent of another device on the entity that is concurrent with it, the two
 * meet in one conflict (`Ledger.crossing`):
 * - through the field patch (both sides readable), each field goes to the
 *   side whose latest write of THAT field is newer (`localWinningFieldGroups`
 *   in conflict-field-patch.util.ts, #10422). The latest write is the newest
 *   write of its field on either side, so it wins every such conflict: none
 *   accounts for another value, whatever else the other side wrote later;
 * - on a whole-entity path (`crossing`'s `whole`, the shapes
 *   `isFieldPatchEligible` refuses), the side with the latest intent wins
 *   (sync-core's planner), and its snapshot can carry any value its device
 *   held: a write of that side or in its causal past accounts for it.
 *
 * This is a stricter model of the shapes the fuzz covers, not an exact model
 * of production: crossings are judged pairwise from intents, and a remote
 * restore or LWW `'replace'` row is approximated (see `WHOLE_ENTITY_INTENTS`
 * and `Ledger.crossing`).
 *
 * Two documented residuals still stamp fields later than they were written
 * (superseded re-emits and `_reemitSurvivingLocalFields`, see "What it
 * leaves" in lww-field-level-resolution.md). An older value one of them
 * carried reports as `older-write-won` too; no seed shows one yet.
 *
 * Concurrent NOTE fields stay on whole-entity LWW (decision 4 of
 * docs/sync-and-op-log/lww-field-level-resolution.md): either side's snapshot
 * may explain a value, but not a baseline both sides overwrote. Concurrent
 * note reorders remain unclassified because the ledger does not index their
 * affected entities. Out of scope, by design:
 * habit counts (`countOnDay`), which are opaque (decision 6). A value no
 * intent wrote is `field-unwritten`'s, not this check's. Pending local LWW
 * rows (re-sends, whole-entity) are not in the ledger, which models intents.
